    "<font color='blue'> The above techniques use the mean answer among people who share a demographic as the estimate for that demographic. But that wastes information _across_ demographics. For example, maybe people who only have \"Some College\" are similar enough to people who have \"High School\" as to provide some useful information. \n",

    "Here, you will earn partial bonus points by just reporting the predictions and comparing them to the means of each covariate group in the raw polling data. Give a scatter-plot, where each point is one combination of full demographics (age, gender, party, race/ethnicity, education), the X axis is the raw polling average for that combination, and the Y axis is your regression prediction for that combination.   \n",
